# Fruity Pie

Fruity Pie is a game developed by a team of 4 for the Dunedin High School game jam in 2022. It is based around a monkey who steals Grandma's fruit bucket and has retreated to the top of a tree. You play as the grandson who must catch the fruit so Grandma can bake her pie. 

Also see the [ODT article](https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/pie-sky-dream-realised-game-jam) about the event and the game we developed.

The true game jam release of the game can be found under [Releases -> v1.0.0](https://github.com/mmoomocow/Grandmas-fruit/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
